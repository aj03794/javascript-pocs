###### Dependency Inversion Principle

- https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/495019/Dependency-Inversion-Principle-and-the-Dependency

- DIP states:
    * High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
    * Abstractions should not depend on deatils. Details should depend upon abstractions.

- DI comes in three flavors:
    * Constructor injection
    * Property injection
    * Method injection
