###### Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding

- Encapsulation is seen as the bundling of daata with the methods that operate on that data
- Information Hiding is the principle that some internal implementation or data is `hidden` so that it can't be accidentally changed
- Data abstraction is present if both data hiding and data encapsulation is used
`Data Abstraction = Data Encapsulation + Data Hiding`

- Encapsulation is often accomplished by providing two kinds of methods for attributes
    - Getter methods do not change the values of attributes, they just return the values
    - Setter methods are using for changing the values of attributes
